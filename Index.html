    <h1>Breaking Down an Internship with Monterey County</h1>
    <h2>Working in the public sector and supporting a county of over 450k users that depend on our services is challenging work.</h2>
    <p>As a generalist within the Information Technology Department with the County of Monterey I was able to work on a menagerie of products, projects, and teams. All of these experiences can be 
        encapsulated by the word: "Service" This is refering to service to both the department but ultimately the people of Monterey County. Our work serves over +400k people who inhabit the county, also the countless visitors, personnel, and vendors that find themselves
        within the our departments Area of Operations. 
    </p>
    <p>My primary goal of the internship with the County was to solidify area of expertise, expand my knowledge of technology integration,
        further my experience with customer support/service for technology products, and get my hands wet in project management under the mentorship
        of project managers of various levels. The team was able to enrich my experience with multiple projects spanning across three different sub-departments within
        the Information Technology department.
    </p>
    <p>Accomplishments of this internship include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Assisting in the Finance team automating data entry for site inventory for 41 different sites, hundreds of devices that exceed an overall value of $30 million (USD) and cutting down processing for billing by over 70%.</li>
        <li>Creating finance visualization for internal finance for the Radio Communications team, exceeding a value of over $23 million in assets in house.</li>
        <li>Contributed to the migration of a team from using excel for database to ServiceNow.</li>
        <li>Volunteered to help the telecommunications department roll out the use of Zoom "soft" phones over physical phones across the department and the entire county.</li>
        
    </ul>
